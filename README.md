### Hi, there! 👋
- I'm Ceci, a junior front-end developer from Spain (I'm actually half Spanish, quarter French, quarter English)👩🏻‍💻.
- I´ve just finished a Development Bootcamp in Adalab (mainly Front-End but also a bit of Back-end)👾.
- I used to work in tv 📺 (specially giving technical support on AVID software) and play in music bands 🎸.
- I've got two cats but I'm the kind of person who says hi to every single dog in the street 🐶🐈.
- I really need a cup of coffee (or two) first thing in the morning ☕️ .
- I love to learn stuff and also teach others 🤓, that's why I feel so confortable in development, such a creative and supportive community ❤️ .

### Technologies
<div align="center">I like React but I'll learn any other framework you need...

### What am I doing right now? 📚🤓

- Developing my personal portfolio (with React JS). I'm still working on it but you can [take a look](https://ceciperiquet.github.io/portfolio/) and tell me what you think 😊

- I'm looking for a job opportunity and keep studying and learning (right now 👇):

  -  [TypeScript basis](https://platzi.com/cursos/typescript/)
  - [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/)
  - [JavaScript 30 (Vanilla JS challenge from Wes Bos)](https://javascript30.com/)
