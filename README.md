### Hi, there! 👋
- I'm Ceci, a junior front-end developer from Spain (I'm actually half Spanish, quarter French, quarter English)👩🏻‍💻.
- I used to make videos, work in tv 📺 and play in music bands 🎸.
- Now I draw, read, design and make zines 📚 .
- I'm curious and hard worker, I love to learn stuff and also teach others 🤓 .
- I've got two cats but I'm the kind of person who says hi to every single dog in the street.
- I really need a coffee first thing in the morning ☕️ .


 ### Technologies
- I kinda like React, but I'll learn any other framework you need...
