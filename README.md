- I'm Ceci, a junior front-end developer from Spain (I'm actually half Spanish, quarter French, quarter English)👩🏻‍💻.
- I used to make videos, worked in tv 📺 and played in music bands 🎸.
- I draw, read, design and make zines 📚 .
- I'm curious and hard worker, I love to learn stuff and then teach others 🤓 .
- I really need a coffee first thing in the morning ☕️ .
- I kinda like React, but I'll learn any other framework you need... 
- Let's collaborate! 😊💻✨
